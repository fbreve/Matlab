# Dataset for Supervised Evaluation of Seed-Based Interactive Image Segmentation Algorithms

__If you find this datase useful, please cite the article.__

This dataset consists of 50 images, ground-truth data and two sets of _scribbles_, and it has been made publicly 
[available](http://sapyc.espe.edu.ec/segevaluation). As can be seen, the images contain an object that could be 
unambiguously extracted by users.

For this compilation, the publicly available 
[GrabCut](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/visionimagevideoediting/segmentation/grabcut.htm) 
and [Geodesic Star convexity dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/iseg/#Dataset) were taken as starting 
point. Original images and ground-truth data are from the GrabCut database.

User inputs are provided by means of two sets of _scribbles_ which indicate foreground and background regions. For 
the first set, we use the _scribbles_ for initializing robot user from the Geodesic Star Convexit dataset. These 
employ on average about 4 strokes per image, yet they mark a small area of the foreground object. Finally, a new 
set of _scribbles_ was created in order to extend this dataset. In this set, the _scribbles_ indicate and mark in 
more detail the foreground region.

These sets reflect two degrees of user effort: the second set marks in more detail foreground regions when compared 
to the first set of _scribbles_.
