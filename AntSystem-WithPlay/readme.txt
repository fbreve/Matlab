In this M-file, the implemention of ACO Algorithm is given with the support of reference papers listed. You can easily use it as following command to see the pictures of result and the iterative playing course.
ACO('filename.tsp');
filename.tsp is the problem file of the Symmetrical or Asymmetrical TSP problem which you can download from the following site: http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/tsp/tsplib/tsp/index.html
As there is several type of ACO algorithm, the basic one Ant System(AS) is given, which is original. For more problems or other ACO algorithms, you can contact me by the email codstar@126.com. plealse make me known if you want to use it commercially.
